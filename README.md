Start translating generational language in an instant, whether you're on desktop or mobile.

## Getting Started
1. If you don't have Flutter SDK installed; Please visit the official [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) website.
2. Fetch the latest source code from the master branch.
    
``` 
git clone https://github.com/ErfanRht/GenSwap.git
```
    
3. Add api key.
    
<ul>
    
GenSwap uses the Gemini AI to fetch the needed data, so before using it you have to create an account on [Gemini AI website](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key), then you can get a free api key in your profile section and apply it to the app by the below steps.
    
- go to `lib/.api.dart`
- you will see the code like this
```dart
final String apiKey = "XXXXXXXXXX";
```
- replace the all `xx..` to your own api key, like this
```dart
final String apiKey = "your_api_key_here";
```
- It's done!
</ul>
    
4. Run the app with Android Studio or Visual Studio. Or the command line.
    
``` 
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## AI-driven
GenSwap leverages the cutting-edge capabilities of [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/aistudio?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw0aS3BhA3EiwAKaD2ZVxZJ_WnrKckI2v7-fQTah__nlGhALWJdshquKIKhdzCB2r-RksMZxoCOkMQAvD_BwE) to deliver accurate and contextual generational language translations.
